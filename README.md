# Bank_Customer_Churn_Predictions
This is a classification Machine Learning Model in which I predicted whether the customer will churn ot not. In this project, I started with EDA and after performing the EDA, I created dummies for the categorical values. In the dataset there were no missing values and the outliers are few in number and upon carefull analysis of the data, the outliers seem to be genuine entries, so the outliers were not removed. As the data was heavily imbalanced with respect to the target variable, so I performed the UpSampling of the dataset using the SMOTE method. After thet, Principal Component Analysis is done to reduce the number of features from 35 to 2 as almost 100% of variance was explained by these 4 features. After that a Random Forest Classifier model was trained on the dataset and after that I performed the Hyperparameter tuning of the model. But it turns out that Hyperparameter optimization did not have any impact on the accuracy of the model and confusion matrix of both optimized and un optimized model was same.
